We want to learn such functions:
    f(x) = w * x + b
where w and b are constant values (e.g. f(x) = 5 * x - 7).

For this, we will define a very simple perceptron (single input, single output).

Homework:

Generalize this simple perceptron to a regular perceptron (i.e. multiple inputs).

Our functions can be:
    f(x1, x2, ..., xN) = w1 * x1 + w2 * x2 + ... + wN * xN + b
where w1, w2, ..., wN and b are constant values (e.g. f(x1, x2) = 3 * x1 - 2 * x2 + 10).
